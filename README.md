__Welcome__ to a game called __GoFaster!__

There is only one thing to do here - to dodge evil ones.

Your indicators will always be visible! Train and brag to your friends. Pump up and break records!

Sinisters and their description:

(!) Triangle, flies from the upper left corner to the lower right corner. The goal is to trap you.

(!) Square, flies from the top or left in the opposite direction. MUCH faster than triangles. The goal is to knock you down.

Killer, flies at the shortest distance to you. The goal is to prevent you from going back.

! - there are 6 of them. Cool, isn't it?

Rumor has it that your color will change to the color of the villain that will hurt you!

Everything is rosy, they feed evil ones, so they won't eat you and will follow their own rules.

Don't forget about the goodies! They are very useful and nutritious. Every time you pick up one, another appears.

Control - WASD or arrows

GoFaster because you're already angry with the player's icon and yelling at him - GoFaster!

P.S. Don't be offended if the game insulted you and sent you here
